import_export_sum/ takes a region or state and a timeframe, then sums up each commodity
imported and exported from the origin separately for each year. This endpoint returns a CSV file containing the name of the origin, the commodity type if it is imported or exported, and the tonnage per year. Currently, this endpoint only works with domestic-traded commodities.
