The variable flow takes a single string value that represents the type of flow, which can be one of the following:

- "Domestic" – Represents a flow within the same country.
- "Foreign-Import" – Represents a flow of goods coming into the country from abroad.
- "Foreign-Export" – Represents a flow of goods leaving the country to be exported abroad.

Only one of these string values should be provided at a time.

Example:
- "Domestic" will provide data related to goods or services that are within the same country.
- "Foreign-Export" will provide data related to goods or services leaving the country.

The string value provided must exactly match one of these options to retrieve the appropriate data.
